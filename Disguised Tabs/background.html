// You're buying choosing a gift online for certain nosy someone
// and you want it to be a surprise. That person enters the room
// and knowing that they have a habit of glancing over your shoulder
// you press Ctrl+Q. The offending tab is instantly disguised to
// look like the google homepage and some other tab (or a new tab)
// is selected for you. The contents of the tab remaining unchanged,
// you are free to continue exactly where you left off as soon as the
// lucky person has disappeared again. Pressing Ctrl+Q a second time
// undisguises the tab.
