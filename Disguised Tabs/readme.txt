You're buying choosing a gift online for certain nosy someone and you want it to be a surprise. That person enters the room and knowing that they have a habit of glancing over your shoulder you press Ctrl+Q. The offending tab is instantly disguised to look like the google homepage and some other tab (or a new tab) is selected for you. The contents of the tab remaining unchanged, you are free to continue exactly where you left off as soon as the lucky person has disappeared again. Pressing Ctrl+Q a second time undisguises the tab.

This extension can be used for similar purposes to the PanicButton extension but comes with several benefits:
+ Tabs are left open, not bookmarked, so no data is lost
+ A more believable result- a single "safe page" left open can seem suspicious
+ No icon, so extension runs invisibly by default

Features I need help with:
- How to stop real page title from displaying in a "disguised" tab when the page is loading. This is more of an annoyance than a point of ineffectiveness, except perhaps for users with slow connections.
- With the current method for disguising the tabs, (see "disguise.js") if a website has no favicon defined it gets stuck with the google one! How to correct this?
- I want to add the feature Ctrl+Shift+Q to set the current page title and favicon as the one used for the disguise. Any pointers as to how to implement this would be of help. I know how to do the keypress bit, its just how to store and retrieve the data.
